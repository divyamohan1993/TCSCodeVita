Below is a complete Python module that converts the given C++ polygon‐processing templates into Python code. Each function is accompanied by detailed comments explaining what it does, when to use it, and how to use it. (For demonstration, the code reads input from standard input in a CodeVita‐style environment.) 

> **Note:**  
> This code assumes that the polygon is given as a list of points in counter‐clockwise order and that points are represented by instances of class `P`. In the code, operators such as “–” and “+” are overloaded and methods such as `.cross()`, `.rot()`, and `.left()` implement the standard 2D vector operations.  
>  
> The constant `EPS` is used for floating–point comparisons.

    The area is computed by summing the cross products of (p[i] - p[0]) and (p[(i+1)%n] - p[i]).
    
    When to use:
      - When you need to compute the area (or twice the area) of a polygon.
    
    How to use:
      - Provide a list of P objects representing the vertices in CCW order.
      - The function returns a number (which may be negative if the points are not in CCW order).

      1 if q is inside,
      0 if q is on the border,
     -1 if q is outside.
    
    How it works:
      - The function iterates over every edge and uses cross products and comparisons 
        to update a winding number (w). It also checks if q lies exactly on an edge.
    
    When to use:
      - When you need a point–in–polygon test for non–convex polygons.

      0 if on the border,
      - if outside.
      
    **Note:** This function assumes there are no collinear points.
    
    How it works:
      - It performs a binary search to find the appropriate sector of the polygon
        and then uses orientation tests.
    
    When to use:
      - When the polygon is convex and fast point–in–polygon queries are needed.

    How it works:
      - It uses a binary search strategy along the polygon.
      - The method compares rotated edge vectors via an angle comparison.

      The square of the maximum distance between any two points in the polygon.
      
    How it works:
      - For each vertex, it rotates a caliper until the area (determined by cross product)
        starts decreasing, keeping track of the maximum squared distance.
    
    When to use:
      - When you need the diameter (farthest distance) of a convex polygon.

    where A is the polygon's area.
    
    When to use:

### What Does This Code Do?

1. **Polygon Area (area2):**  
   - **What:** Computes twice the area of a simple polygon.
   - **When:** Use it when you need the area (or to check orientation) of a polygon.
   - **How:** Call `area2(polygon)` with a list of `P` points.

2. **Point In Polygon (in_poly):**  
   - **What:** Determines whether a point is inside, on the border, or outside a polygon.
   - **When:** Use this for general (possibly non–convex) polygons.
   - **How:** Call `in_poly(polygon, q)` with your polygon and a query point `q`.

3. **Point In Convex Polygon (in_convex):**  
   - **What:** Uses binary search to test if a point is in a convex polygon.
   - **When:** Use it for convex polygons when you need a fast (O(log n)) test.
   - **How:** Call `in_convex(polygon, q)`.

4. **Extremal Vertex (extremal):**  
   - **What:** Finds the vertex of a convex polygon that is farthest in a given direction.
   - **When:** Useful in optimization and collision–detection problems.
   - **How:** Call `extremal(polygon, d)` with the polygon and a direction vector `d`.

5. **Rotating Calipers (callipers):**  
   - **What:** Computes the squared diameter (max squared distance between any two points) of a convex polygon.
   - **When:** Use it to find the farthest pair of points (polygon diameter).
   - **How:** Call `callipers(polygon)`.

6. **Centroid:**  
   - **What:** Computes the center of mass (barycenter) of the polygon.
   - **When:** When you need the geometric center.
   - **How:** Call `centroid(polygon)`.

7. **Inner Collision Classification (inner_collide):**  
   - **What:** Classifies how a ray collides with a polygon vertex.
   - **When:** Use it in collision detection or ray–casting problems.
   - **How:** Call `inner_collide(o, d, a, b, c)` with appropriate points.

### How to Use This Code

- **Input:**  
  Run the script and provide the required inputs via standard input. For example:
  ```
  4
  0 0
  4 0
  4 3
  0 3
  2 1
  ```
  This represents a rectangle with vertices (0,0), (4,0), (4,3), (0,3) and a query point (2,1).

- **Execution:**  
  The main function reads the polygon, computes twice the area, tests whether the query point lies inside, and prints the centroid.

- **Output:**  
  The program prints the computed values and messages indicating the status of the query point.

This module is designed to be beginner–friendly with clear inline explanations so you can learn how these geometric algorithms work and implement them in a competitive programming environment like CodeVita.
