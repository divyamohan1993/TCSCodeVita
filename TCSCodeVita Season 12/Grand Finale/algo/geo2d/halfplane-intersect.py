Below is a Python version of the given half‐plane intersection function. In this implementation, we assume that you already have classes for points (typically called `P`) and lines (typically called `L`) with methods such as:

- **For a point (`P`):**
  - `rot()`: returns the 90° counterclockwise rotated vector.
  - (Possibly) an `angle()` method (or similar) that returns the angle (in radians) of the point viewed as a vector from the origin.

- **For a line (`L`):**
  - `intersection(other)`: returns the intersection point of two lines.
  - `side(p)`: returns a value (positive, zero, or negative) indicating on which side of the line the point `p` lies (the halfplane “inside” is taken to be the left side).
  - `parallel(other)`: returns whether two lines are parallel.
  - The direction vector `d` (of type `P`) whose angle is used for sorting.
  - The origin point `o` (of type `P`).

In this algorithm the halfplanes are given as lines where the “allowed” region is the left side of the directed line. (It assumes the overall intersection is bounded.)

Below is the Python function, with inline comments that explain each part:

```python
import math

# A very large constant (used as INF)
INF = 10**18

def halfplane_intersect(H):
    """
    Given a list H of halfplanes (each represented as a line L such that the allowed
    region is its left side), this function computes the convex polygon that is their intersection.
    It assumes the intersection is bounded.
    """
    # Add four bounding halfplanes.
    # Here, we create a halfplane bb with origin (-INF, -INF) and direction (INF, 0).
    bb = L(P(-INF, -INF), P(INF, 0))
    for k in range(4):
        H.append(bb)
        # Rotate the halfplane by 90° for the next boundary.
        bb.o = bb.o.rot()
        bb.d = bb.d.rot()

    # Sort the halfplanes by the angle of their direction vector.
    # We assume that line.d.angle() returns the angle (in radians) of the direction vector.
    H.sort(key=lambda line: line.d.angle())

    # Initialize a deque (we use a Python list with pop(0) for the front).
    q = []
    for i in range(len(H)):
        # Remove from the back while the intersection of the last two lines in q
        # is not inside the halfplane H[i].
        while len(q) >= 2 and H[i].side(q[-1].intersection(q[-2])) > 0:
            q.pop()
        # Remove from the front while the intersection of the first two lines in q
        # is not inside the halfplane H[i].
        while len(q) >= 2 and H[i].side(q[0].intersection(q[1])) > 0:
            q.pop(0)
        # If H[i] is parallel to the last halfplane in q, handle specially.
        if q and H[i].parallel(q[-1]):
            # If their direction vectors are oppositely oriented, no intersection exists.
            if H[i].d * q[-1].d < 0:
                return []
            # If H[i] is "more inside", remove the last element.
            if H[i].side(q[-1].o) > 0:
                q.pop()
            else:
                # Otherwise, skip adding H[i].
                continue
        q.append(H[i])

    # Final cleanup: remove from the back and front until the remaining halfplanes form a valid polygon.
    while len(q) >= 3 and q[0].side(q[-1].intersection(q[-2])) > 0:
        q.pop()
    while len(q) >= 3 and q[-1].side(q[0].intersection(q[1])) > 0:
        q.pop(0)
    if len(q) < 3:
        return []

    # Compute the intersection points of consecutive halfplanes to form the polygon.
    ps = []
    n = len(q)
    for i in range(n):
        ps.append(q[i].intersection(q[(i + 1) % n]))
    return ps

### Explanation

#### What It Does

- **Bounding Halfplanes:**  
  The function first adds four extra halfplanes that “bound” the entire region (using a very large constant `INF`). These guarantee that the intersection is bounded.

- **Sorting by Angle:**  
  The halfplanes are then sorted by the angle of their direction vector. This is important to process them in a consistent order.

- **Processing via a Deque:**  
  The algorithm maintains a “deque” (here simulated with a Python list) of candidate halfplanes. For each new halfplane, it removes candidates from the back or front if the intersection of the candidate halfplanes does not lie inside the new halfplane.

- **Handling Parallel Lines:**  
  If the new halfplane is parallel to the last candidate, then depending on the orientation and side tests, it either replaces the candidate or is skipped.

- **Final Cleanup:**  
  After processing all halfplanes, the algorithm removes any extra candidates so that the remaining ones form a valid convex polygon.

- **Output:**  
  The function returns the vertices (as a list of points) of the convex polygon resulting from the intersection of all the halfplanes.

#### When to Use It

- **Geometry Problems:**  
  Use this function when you need to compute the intersection of many halfplanes—common in problems dealing with linear constraints or computing the feasible region in optimization problems.

- **Competitive Programming:**  
  Many contest problems require computing a convex polygon defined by a set of inequalities. This algorithm works in \(O(n \log n)\) time.

#### How to Use It

1. **Implement or Import Required Classes:**  
   Make sure you have a `Point` class (or equivalent) that supports operations such as rotation and computing an angle. Also, a `Line` class (`L`) must be implemented with methods:
   - `intersection(other)` – returns the intersection point of two lines.
   - `side(p)` – returns a value indicating on which side of the line the point `p` lies.
   - `parallel(other)` – checks if two lines are parallel.
   - An attribute `d` (a point) representing the direction vector (and a method to compute its angle).

2. **Prepare the Input List:**  
   Create a list of halfplanes (lines) where each halfplane is represented by a line that “allows” its left side.

3. **Call the Function:**  
   Pass the list of halfplanes to `halfplane_intersect(H)` and capture the returned list of points (the vertices of the intersection polygon).

4. **Use the Output:**  
   The resulting list of points is the convex polygon in counterclockwise order.

This Python function is a direct translation of the C++ template and should be integrated with your other geometry routines in a competitive programming environment. Happy coding!
