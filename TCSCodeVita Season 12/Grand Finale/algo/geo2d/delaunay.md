Below is one possible “translation” of the given C++ Delaunay‐triangulation template into Python. (Keep in mind that the original uses an advanced quad‐edge data structure with many pointer‐tricks; the Python version uses object references to simulate pointers. This code is quite advanced and “low‐level” in style. It is meant to be used in competitive programming problems that require a Delaunay triangulation (or “optimal” triangulation) of a set of 2D points.) 

In our translation we define a simple Point class (with basic arithmetic and a method for “magnitude‑squared”), a quad‐edge class Q, and the functions  
• *cross(a,b,c)* – which computes the 2D cross product (area determinant) of triangle *abc*  
• *circ(p,a,b,c)* – which returns whether point *p* lies inside the circumcircle of triangle *abc*  
• *makeEdge(H,orig,dest)*, *splice(a,b)*, *connect(H,a,b)*, and the recursive function *rec(H,s)* that builds the triangulation  
• *triangulate(pts)* – which sorts and “uniquifies” the input points, calls *rec*, and then “extracts” the (counter‐clockwise) triangle edges.

Because some functions expect “H” (a pointer to a “handle” used for memory‐management in the original code) to be updated by reference, we simulate that by passing a single–element list (so that updates persist).

Below the code is an explanation of what the code does, when you might use it, and how to use it.

### Explanation

#### What It Does

This code is an implementation of Delaunay triangulation using a divide‐and‐conquer algorithm built on a quad‐edge structure. In brief:

- **Point & cross:**  
  The `Point` class represents a 2D point and supports basic operations. The function `cross(a, b, c)` computes the orientation (area/determinant) for three points.

- **Circumcircle test:**  
  The `circ(p, a, b, c)` function checks whether point *p* lies inside the circumcircle of the triangle formed by *a, b, c*. This is key for the Delaunay property.

- **Quad‐Edge (class Q):**  
  The `Q` class simulates an edge in the quad‐edge data structure. Each “edge” is represented by a cycle of four Q objects. Methods such as `F()`, `r()`, `prev()`, and `next()` let you navigate around the edge’s “rotations” and around its endpoints.

- **Core functions:**  
  Functions like `makeEdge`, `splice`, `connect`, and the recursive `rec` implement the divide–and–conquer Delaunay triangulation. Finally, `triangulate(pts)` wraps everything together, returning (for example) a list of points that appear in the triangulation.

#### When to Use It

- **Competitive Programming / Geometry Problems:**  
  Use this code when you need to compute a triangulation (especially a Delaunay triangulation) of a set of points. It can be used to solve problems involving mesh generation, closest–pair queries, or other advanced geometric computations.

- **Maximizing Minimum Angles:**  
  The produced triangulation maximizes the minimum angle among triangles (a desirable property in many applications).

#### How to Use It

1. **Input Format:**  
   The code expects input from standard input (stdin) with the first number being the number of points, followed by that many lines of “x y” coordinates.

2. **Running the Code:**  
   Paste the code into your Python environment (or an online judge). When you run it, provide the input in the described format.

3. **Understanding the Output:**  
   The code prints one line per output point (each “x y”). (In a full application you might wish to output the triangle triples; here the template collects and prints unique endpoints.)

---

> **Note:**  
> This Python translation follows the structure and logic of the original C++ template as closely as possible. Due to its low‐level pointer manipulations and macro–style code in C++, the Python version is intricate and may require further testing and debugging before use in a contest.

Happy coding!
