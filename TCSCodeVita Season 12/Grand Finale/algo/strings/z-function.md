Below is a complete Python script that implements the Z-function algorithm based on the provided C++ template. The code is written in a beginner-friendly style with plenty of comments and an explanation of each step. It reads input from standard input (like in a CodeVita environment), computes the Z-function for the given string, and prints the resulting array.

```python
import sys

def z_function(s):
    """
    Compute the Z-function for a string s.
    
    The Z-function for a string is an array where the i-th element is equal to 
    the greatest number of characters starting from position i that coincide with 
    the first characters of s.
    
    How it works:
      - It uses two pointers, l and r, to maintain an interval [l, r) such that
        s[l:r] is a substring that matches the prefix of s.
      - For each position i starting from 1, it first tries to use the previous 
        computed Z-values to avoid unnecessary comparisons.
      - Then, it extends the matching as far as possible.
      - If the matching interval extends past r, update l and r accordingly.
    
    Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string.
    
    When to use:
      - Use the Z-function when you need to quickly find occurrences of a pattern 
        inside a text by concatenating the pattern, a special character, and the text.
      - Useful in many string matching and processing problems.
    
    How to use:
      - Call z_function(your_string) to get a list of Z-values.
    """
    n = len(s)
    z = [0] * n  # Initialize Z-array with zeros.
    l, r = 0, 0  # l and r define the current segment which matches a prefix of s.
    
    # Start from i=1 since z[0] is trivial (the entire string matches itself).
    for i in range(1, n):
        if i < r:
            # Use the previously computed Z-value to avoid re-computation.
            z[i] = min(r - i, z[i - l])
        # Extend the match starting from i as far as possible.
        while i + z[i] < n and s[z[i]] == s[i + z[i]]:
            z[i] += 1
        # Update the segment [l, r] if we extended beyond the current r.
        if i + z[i] > r:
            l, r = i, i + z[i]
    return z

def main():
    """
    Main function:
      1. Reads input from standard input (a single string).
      2. Computes the Z-function for the input string.
      3. Prints the resulting Z-array.
    
    Input format (example):
        abacaba
    """
    # Read input from standard input (like CodeVita environment)
    input_data = sys.stdin.read().strip()
    if not input_data:
        print("No input provided. Please enter a string.")
        return
    
    # Consider the first token as the input string
    s = input_data.split()[0]
    
    # Compute the Z-function for the string s
    z = z_function(s)
    
    # Print the Z-function array
    print("Z-function array:")
    print(z)

### What Does This Code Do?

1. **Z-Function Computation**  
   - The `z_function` function calculates an array where each element `z[i]` represents the length of the longest substring starting at `i` that matches the prefix of the string.
   - It uses a two-pointer technique (with pointers `l` and `r`) to efficiently compute these values in linear time.

2. **When to Use the Z-Function**  
   - **Pattern Matching:** You can use the Z-function to locate a pattern within a text. For example, by concatenating the pattern, a special character (that does not appear in either the pattern or the text), and the text.
   - **String Processing:** It is useful in problems where you need to analyze or compare substrings efficiently.

3. **How to Use It**  
   - **Input:**  
     - Run the script and provide a single string as input.  
   - **Execution:**  
     - The script reads the input string, computes its Z-function, and prints the Z-array.
   - **Output:**  
     - The printed Z-array shows the number of characters from each position that match the prefix of the string.

This script is ideal for beginners since it is well-commented, explains the process step-by-step, and follows a simple input/output format suitable for competitive programming environments.
