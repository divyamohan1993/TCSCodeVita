Below is the equivalent Python code for the given RMQ (range‐minimum query) structure along with an explanation of its use. This RMQ uses an O(n) preprocessing that builds block information (with bit‐masks in “mk” and a sparse table over blocks in “bk”) so that each query runs in O(1) time. (For maximum queries you would “flip” the comparisons and change the INF value.)

### Explanation

#### What the Code Does
- **Preprocessing (O(n)):**  
  The constructor processes the input array by dividing it into blocks of 32 elements. For each element, it maintains a bitmask (stored in `mk`) that helps quickly identify the position of the minimum within the block. In parallel, it computes the minimum value in each block (stored in `bk`).

- **Sparse Table over Blocks:**  
  After processing each block, a sparse table is built on the block minima. This allows the query to combine the full blocks that lie entirely within the query range in O(1) time.

- **Query (O(1)):**  
  The `query(s, e)` method answers a range minimum query on the interval \[s, e\] (inclusive). It handles three parts:
  1. The left partial block (from s to the end of its block).
  2. The right partial block (from the start of e’s block to e).
  3. The full blocks in between (queried via the sparse table).

- **Bit Trick Helpers:**  
  The functions `ctz` and `clz` simulate the behavior of GCC’s built‐in functions for counting trailing and leading zeros in a 32‐bit integer.

#### When to Use This Algorithm
- **Static Range Queries:**  
  Use this RMQ structure when you have a static array (or one that doesn’t change often) and you need to answer many range minimum (or maximum) queries quickly.

- **O(n) Build and O(1) Query:**  
  Its preprocessing time is linear (O(n)), and each query is answered in constant time. This is ideal when you have many queries and can afford one-time preprocessing.

- **Competitive Programming and Offline Queries:**  
  This type of RMQ is popular in contests and other scenarios where quick query responses are required after an initial preprocessing step.

For maximum queries, you would simply change the operator (using maximum instead of minimum) and adjust the INF value accordingly.
