Python equivalent code using a Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree) implementation, followed by an explanation of what it does and when to use it.

```python
MAXN = 1000  # or any desired maximum value
ft = [0] * (MAXN + 1)

def upd(i0, v):
    """
    Adds value v to the i0-th element.
    The BIT is 1-indexed internally, so we update starting from i0+1.
    """
    i = i0 + 1
    while i <= MAXN:
        ft[i] += v
        i += i & -i

def get(i0):
    """
    Returns the sum of the range [0, i0).
    """
    r = 0
    i = i0
    while i:
        r += ft[i]
        i -= i & -i
    return r

def get_sum(i0, i1):
    """
    Returns the sum of the range [i0, i1).
    """
    return get(i1) - get(i0)
```

### What Is This Algorithm Used For?

This algorithm implements a **Binary Indexed Tree (BIT)**, also known as a **Fenwick Tree**. It is designed to efficiently perform two key operations on an array:

1. **Update an element:** Increase or change the value of a specific element.
2. **Prefix sum query:** Compute the sum of elements from the beginning of the array up to a given index.

Both operations run in \( O(\log n) \) time, making BIT an efficient choice for problems involving frequent updates and queries on cumulative sums.

### When to Use a Binary Indexed Tree

- **Dynamic Array Sum Queries:** When you have an array where values change over time (updates) and you need to frequently compute the sum of a range of elements.
- **Cumulative Frequency Tables:** In scenarios where you need to quickly compute cumulative counts, such as in frequency distributions or in solving order-statistics problems.
- **Competitive Programming:** BIT is popular in competitive programming due to its efficiency and relative ease of implementation for problems involving range sum queries and updates.
- **Real-Time Data Processing:** When real-time updates and quick retrieval of aggregated data (like running totals) are required, such as in financial data streams or sensor data processing.

The BIT is especially useful when the data structure needs to handle a high volume of update and query operations efficiently.
