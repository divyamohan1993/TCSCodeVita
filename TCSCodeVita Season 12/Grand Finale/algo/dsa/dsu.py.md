The algorithm is a version of the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) or Union-Find data structure, but with added rollback functionality. Here's what it does and when you might use it:

### What It Does

- **DSU (Disjoint Set Union):**  
  It efficiently handles operations on sets (or "components") such as merging two sets (unite) and checking if two elements belong to the same set (same_set). This is especially useful for connectivity queries in graphs.

- **Rollback Capability:**  
  The rollback feature allows you to revert the last union operation. This is particularly useful when you need to "undo" changes, such as when exploring multiple scenarios (e.g., in backtracking or divide-and-conquer algorithms).

### When to Use It

- **Dynamic Connectivity:**  
  When you're dealing with graphs where edges might be added and removed, and you need to answer connectivity queries efficiently. The rollback DSU lets you simulate edge removals by rolling back union operations.

- **Offline Query Processing:**  
  In scenarios where you can process queries offline (for example, queries that involve time intervals), the rollback feature allows you to efficiently explore different states of the DSU without having to rebuild the structure from scratch each time.

- **Backtracking Algorithms:**  
  When solving problems that require exploring various possibilities and then undoing changes (such as in some recursive or iterative search algorithms), rollback DSU is very useful.

- **Divide and Conquer Optimization:**  
  In algorithms that divide the problem into smaller parts (such as some advanced graph algorithms or certain dynamic programming approaches), the ability to roll back union operations lets you combine results from subproblems while maintaining correct state.

Use this algorithm when you have a scenario that benefits from the efficiency of DSU for merging and querying sets, but also requires the flexibility to undo operations as you explore different solution paths.

```python
class Dsu:
    def __init__(self, N=0):
        # p[i] stores the parent (or negative size if i is a root)
        self.p = [-1] * N
        # Stack for rollback operations
        self.S = []

    def get(self, x):
        # Find the representative of x without path compression.
        if self.p[x] < 0:
            return x
        return self.get(self.p[x])

    def same_set(self, a, b):
        # Check if a and b belong to the same set.
        return self.get(a) == self.get(b)

    def size(self, x):
        # Return the size of the set containing x.
        return -self.p[self.get(x)]

    def unite(self, x, y):
        # Unite the sets containing x and y.
        x = self.get(x)
        y = self.get(y)
        if x == y:
            # If already in the same set, record a dummy operation.
            self.S.append([-1])
            return
        # Ensure that x is the root of the larger set.
        if self.p[x] > self.p[y]:
            x, y = y, x
        # Record the state for rollback.
        self.S.append([x, y, self.p[x], self.p[y]])
        # Merge the sets.
        self.p[x] += self.p[y]
        self.p[y] = x

    def rollback(self):
        # Rollback the last union operation.
        a = self.S.pop()
        if a[0] != -1:
            self.p[a[0]] = a[2]
            self.p[a[1]] = a[3]
