Below is one way to “translate” the given C++ hash-combination utilities into Python. In C++ the code defines helper functions to obtain a hash for a value, to combine two hash values using bit‐mixing (using shifts, XOR, and a magic constant), and then to define custom hash functions for common containers such as pairs, vectors, and maps. In Python many built-in types (like tuples) already have a hash, but for mutable types (lists, dicts) or for custom containers you may want to mimic a similar hash-combining strategy.

Below is a Python version that defines similar functions. We define:
 
- **mk_h(v):** Returns the built-in hash of *v*.
- **h_cmb(h, v):** Combines an existing hash value `h` with a new hash value `v` using a formula inspired by the C++ version.
- **h_ct(iterable):** Given an iterable, computes a combined hash for all of its elements.
- **hash_pair(pair):** Computes a combined hash for a 2-tuple.
- **hash_vector(vec):** Computes a combined hash for a list (or any iterable).
- **hash_map(m):** Computes a combined hash for a dictionary by sorting its items (since dicts are unordered).

You can use these functions when you need to define a custom hash function for composite objects.

```python
def mk_h(v):
    """
    Compute the built-in hash of v.
    In C++ this is like: hash<T>()(v)
    """
    return hash(v)


def h_cmb(h, v):
    """
    Combine two hash values h and v.
    This mimics the C++ function:
      h ^= v + 0x9e3779b9 + (h << 6) + (h >> 2);
    Since Python integers are unbounded, this formula works as well.
    """
    # 0x9e3779b9 is a constant used to mix bits.
    return h ^ (v + 0x9e3779b9 + (h << 6) + (h >> 2))


def h_ct(iterable):
    """
    Compute a combined hash for all elements in an iterable.
    This is similar to the C++ functor h_ct.
    """
    h = 0
    for e in iterable:
        h = h_cmb(h, mk_h(e))
    return h


def hash_pair(pair):
    """
    Compute a combined hash for a pair (2-tuple).
    Mimics the specialization for pair<T,U> in C++.
    """
    a, b = pair
    h = mk_h(a)
    h = h_cmb(h, mk_h(b))
    return h


def hash_vector(vec):
    """
    Compute a combined hash for a vector (or list).
    In C++ this is done by h_ct<vector<T...>>.
    Note: Lists in Python are mutable and not hashable by default,
    so we compute a hash based on their contents.
    """
    return h_ct(vec)


def hash_map(m):
    """
    Compute a combined hash for a map (or dict in Python).
    In C++ the hash for map<T,U> is defined via h_ct<map<T...>>.
    Since dictionaries are unordered, we first sort the items.
    """
    # Sorting by key to ensure order-independence.
    items = sorted(m.items())
    return h_ct(items)


# ---------------------------
# Example usage:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Pair example:
    p = (42, "hello")
    print("Hash for pair (42, 'hello'):", hash_pair(p))

    # Vector (list) example:
    vec = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    print("Hash for vector [1, 2, 3, 4]:", hash_vector(vec))

    # Map (dict) example:
    m = {'apple': 5, 'banana': 7, 'cherry': 3}
    print("Hash for map {'apple':5, 'banana':7, 'cherry':3}:", hash_map(m))
```

### What Does This Code Do?

1. **Hashing a Single Value (`mk_h`):**  
   - Uses Python’s built-in `hash()` to obtain a hash for a value.
   
2. **Combining Hashes (`h_cmb`):**  
   - Takes two hash values and “mixes” them using bitwise XOR, shifts, and a magic constant. This is similar to the C++ snippet that mixes bits to produce a combined hash.
   
3. **Hashing Iterables (`h_ct`):**  
   - Iterates over an iterable (e.g. list, tuple, or sorted items from a dictionary) and combines the hash of each element into a single hash value.
   
4. **Specialized Hash Functions:**  
   - **`hash_pair`:** Combines the hash values for the first and second elements of a tuple (acting as a pair).
   - **`hash_vector`:** Uses `h_ct` to compute a hash for a list (or vector).  
   - **`hash_map`:** For a dictionary, sorts its items (to handle unordered keys) and then computes a combined hash using `h_ct`.

### When and How to Use This

- **When to Use:**  
  Use these functions when you need a custom hash for composite objects that are not hashable by default in Python. For instance, if you need to store a list or a dictionary as a key in another dictionary, you can compute a custom hash using these functions.

- **How to Use:**  
  1. Import or include these functions in your code.
  2. Call the appropriate function (e.g. `hash_pair`, `hash_vector`, or `hash_map`) when you need to compute a hash for a complex object.
  3. Use the computed hash as needed (for example, in your own hash-based data structures or caching mechanisms).

This translation preserves the idea of custom hash combination from the C++ version while using Python’s built-in facilities. Happy coding!
