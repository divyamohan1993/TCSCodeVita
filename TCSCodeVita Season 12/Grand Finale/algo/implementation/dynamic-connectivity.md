Below is one way to convert the C++ code into Python. In this snippet we use an offline “divide and conquer” structure to process dynamic connectivity (or similar interval‐based queries) with rollback in a disjoint set union (DSU). In the C++ version the structure “DC” maintains a segment tree (array t of size 2*n) where each node stores a list of “edges” (here represented as pairs of integers) to add during a certain time interval. Then the process function applies unions for all edges in the current segment, recurses into the children, and finally “rolls back” the DSU state.

Below is a full Python version with detailed comments.

        # or a tuple (b, old_size_b) indicating that node b was attached.
        self.history = []

        # Ensure that we attach the smaller tree to the larger one.

### What Does This Code Do?

1. **DSU with Rollback:**
   - **Purpose:**  
     The DSU (Disjoint Set Union) data structure supports union operations and can “roll back” the most recent union. This is useful when processing offline queries that temporarily add edges.
   - **How it works:**  
     When uniting two sets, the DSU records what changed (i.e. which node was attached and its previous size) on a history stack. The `rollback` function undoes the last union operation.

2. **DC Class (Divide and Conquer Structure):**
   - **Purpose:**  
     The DC class uses a segment tree to manage intervals. For every update (edge addition), it adds that edge to every segment covering the interval \([l, r)\). Later, when processing, it “applies” these edges (by performing DSU.unite) at each segment (or time point) and then recovers (rolls back) the DSU state after processing.
   - **How it works:**  
     - The `upd` method maps an interval update to the segment tree nodes.
     - The `process` method performs a recursive DFS on the segment tree. At each node, it applies all edge additions stored there, processes children (or outputs answers at leaves), and then undoes those unions with rollbacks.

3. **When and How to Use:**
   - **When to Use It:**  
     Use this template when you have a sequence of updates (or queries) that affect the connectivity (or similar DSU-based property) of a dynamic graph over time, and you want to answer queries offline.
   - **How to Use It (for Beginners):**  
     - **Input:**  
       Format your input as described in the comments (first the number of vertices, then the number of updates, followed by the updates). Adjust the input format to your problem’s requirements.
     - **Running the Code:**  
       Save the code (e.g., as `solution.py`), then run it using:
       ```bash
       python solution.py < input.txt
       ```
       where `input.txt` contains your test cases.
     - **Modifications:**  
       In the `process` method at the leaf nodes (where `u >= n`), replace the placeholder code with your actual query processing (e.g., answering connectivity queries).

This Python version captures the essential behavior of the original C++ structure while using Python’s lists and recursion to simulate the segment tree and rollback operations.

Happy coding!
