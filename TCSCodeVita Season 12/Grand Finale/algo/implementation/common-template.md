Below is an example Python “template” that mimics many of the ideas from the C++ competitive programming template you showed. In Python, many things are simpler (or slower) than in C/C++ so we often don’t need the heavy optimizations. However, if you want to do similar bit manipulation and fast input in a CodeVita‐like environment, you can use the following code.

---

```python
import sys
import math

# Fast input from stdin (useful in competitive programming)
# Reads all input at once and splits it into tokens.
def fast_input():
    data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()
    return data

# --- Bit Manipulation Utilities ---

# Popcount: counts the number of 1-bits in x.
def popcount(x):
    return bin(x).count('1')

# Parity: returns True if x has an odd number of 1-bits, else False.
def parity(x):
    return popcount(x) % 2 == 1

# Count Leading Zeros (for a fixed bit width, e.g., 32 bits)
def clz(x, bits=32):
    # Format x as a binary string with leading zeros and count zeros before the first '1'
    binary_str = format(x, '0{}b'.format(bits))
    return len(binary_str) - len(binary_str.lstrip('0'))

# Count Trailing Zeros
def ctz(x):
    if x == 0:
        return 0  # convention: trailing zeros of 0 is undefined, here we return 0
    count = 0
    while (x & 1) == 0:
        count += 1
        x >>= 1
    return count

# Find First Set Bit (1-indexed): returns index of least significant 1-bit
def ffs(x):
    if x == 0:
        return 0
    return ctz(x) + 1

# Bitwise operations examples:
def bitwise_examples(x):
    # Turn off rightmost 1-bit: x & (x - 1)
    turn_off_rightmost = x & (x - 1)
    
    # Isolate rightmost 1-bit: x & (-x)
    isolate_rightmost = x & -x
    
    # Right propagate rightmost 1-bit: x | (x - 1)
    propagate_rightmost = x | (x - 1)
    
    # Turn on rightmost 0-bit: x | (x + 1)
    turn_on_rightmost_zero = x | (x + 1)
    
    # Isolate rightmost 0-bit: (~x) & (x + 1)
    isolate_rightmost_zero = (~x) & (x + 1)
    
    return (turn_off_rightmost, isolate_rightmost, propagate_rightmost,
            turn_on_rightmost_zero, isolate_rightmost_zero)

# Iterate over non-empty subsets of a bitmask 'm'
def iterate_subsets(m):
    subsets = []
    s = m
    while s:
        subsets.append(s)
        s = (s - 1) & m  # move to the next subset
    return subsets

# --- Main Program ---
# This template reads input from stdin and demonstrates the use of the functions above.
# To run a test, provide input via standard input. For example, in CodeVita you would read the problem input.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Read input tokens (as strings)
    tokens = fast_input()
    
    # For demonstration, we assume the first token is an integer 'x' and the second is a bitmask 'm'.
    # In an actual contest problem, you'll process the input as per problem requirements.
    if tokens:
        try:
            x = int(tokens[0])
        except:
            x = 0
        m = int(tokens[1]) if len(tokens) > 1 else 0
        
        print("x =", x)
        print("popcount(x):", popcount(x))
        print("parity(x):", parity(x))
        print("clz(x) for 32 bits:", clz(x, bits=32))
        print("ctz(x):", ctz(x))
        print("ffs(x):", ffs(x))
        
        bit_ops = bitwise_examples(x)
        print("Bitwise examples for x:")
        print("  Turn off rightmost 1-bit (x & (x-1)):", bit_ops[0])
        print("  Isolate rightmost 1-bit (x & -x):", bit_ops[1])
        print("  Right propagate rightmost 1-bit (x | (x-1)):", bit_ops[2])
        print("  Turn on rightmost 0-bit (x | (x+1)):", bit_ops[3])
        print("  Isolate rightmost 0-bit (~x & (x+1)):", bit_ops[4])
        
        print("\nNon-empty subsets of bitmask m =", m)
        subsets = iterate_subsets(m)
        for s in subsets:
            print(s)
```

### What Does This Code Do?

1. **Fast Input**:  
   - The `fast_input()` function reads the entire input from standard input (usually provided in a contest) and splits it into tokens.  
   - **When to use it**: Use this function when you expect a lot of input data and want to avoid the overhead of calling `input()` repeatedly.

2. **Bit Manipulation Functions**:  
   - **popcount(x)**: Counts how many bits in `x` are 1.  
   - **parity(x)**: Checks if the number of 1 bits in `x` is odd (returns `True`) or even (returns `False`).  
   - **clz(x, bits=32)**: Counts leading zeros in the binary representation of `x` given a fixed bit width (default is 32 bits).  
   - **ctz(x)**: Counts the trailing zeros in `x`.  
   - **ffs(x)**: Finds the position (1-indexed) of the least significant bit that is set to 1.  
   - **When to use these**: These functions are useful in problems involving bit masks, subset enumeration, or optimizations that rely on bit-level operations.

3. **Bitwise Operations Examples**:  
   - Demonstrates how to:
     - Turn off the rightmost 1-bit.
     - Isolate the rightmost 1-bit.
     - Propagate the rightmost 1-bit.
     - Turn on the rightmost 0-bit.
     - Isolate the rightmost 0-bit.
   - **When to use them**: In many competitive programming problems, manipulating bits directly can lead to elegant and efficient solutions.

4. **Iterating Over Subsets of a Bitmask**:  
   - The `iterate_subsets(m)` function generates all non-empty subsets of a given bitmask `m` in decreasing order.  
   - **When to use it**: This technique is common in dynamic programming problems where you need to consider all possible combinations (subsets) of a set represented by a bitmask.

5. **Main Program Block**:  
   - This part of the code shows how to use the above functions. It reads input, converts tokens to integers, and prints results of various bit manipulation operations.
   - **How to use it**: For a beginner, simply run the script and provide input as required by your contest environment (e.g., CodeVita). For example, if you input:
     ```
     13 7
     ```
     It will treat `x = 13` and `m = 7` and show the results of the functions.

### How to Use This Template

- **Setup**: Copy the code into a Python file (e.g., `solution.py`).
- **Input**: Provide the input as specified by the problem (this template reads from standard input).
- **Run**: In a contest environment like CodeVita, you can run your solution. Locally, you might use:
  ```bash
  python solution.py < input.txt
  ```
- **Modify**: Use the functions provided as building blocks. For example, if a problem requires you to count bits or iterate over subsets, simply call `popcount(x)` or `iterate_subsets(m)`.

This template is a starting point. As you gain more experience, you can add more helper functions or modify the template to suit your problem-solving style.

Happy coding!
