Below is one way to “translate” the Mo’s algorithm template into Python. In competitive programming, Mo’s algorithm is used to answer offline range queries in an array by only using three operations:

- **add(i):** incorporate the i-th element into the current segment  
- **remove(i):** remove the i-th element from the current segment  
- **get():** return the current answer for the segment

Mo’s algorithm works by sorting the queries in a specific order (using block decomposition) so that the total number of add/remove operations is minimized. The following Python code defines a simple `Query` class and a generic function `mo` that processes all queries. You need to supply your own `add`, `remove`, and `get` functions based on your problem.

```python
import math

class Query:
    def __init__(self, l, r, idx):
        self.l = l  # left endpoint (inclusive)
        self.r = r  # right endpoint (exclusive)
        self.idx = idx  # original index of the query

def mo(queries, ans, add, remove, get):
    """
    Process range queries on an array using Mo's algorithm.
    
    Parameters:
      queries : list of Query objects.
      ans     : list to store the answer for each query.
      add     : function add(i) that processes the element at index i.
      remove  : function remove(i) that removes the element at index i.
      get     : function get() that returns the current answer for the segment.
    
    The algorithm sorts the queries by blocks (of size sqrt(Q)) and then 
    adjusts a sliding window [l, r) by calling add() and remove() accordingly.
    """
    Q = len(queries)
    # Block size is typically sqrt(number of queries)
    B = int(math.sqrt(Q))
    # Sort queries by (block index of l, then by r)
    queries.sort(key=lambda q: (q.l // B, q.r))
    
    # Ensure ans has enough space for all query answers
    ans[:] = [None] * Q

    l, r = 0, 0  # current segment is empty: [l, r)
    for q in queries:
        # Extend the right bound to match q.r
        while r < q.r:
            add(r)
            r += 1
        # Extend to the left if needed
        while l > q.l:
            l -= 1
            add(l)
        # Shrink the right bound if needed
        while r > q.r:
            r -= 1
            remove(r)
        # Shrink the left bound if needed
        while l < q.l:
            remove(l)
            l += 1
        ans[q.idx] = get()
```

### What Does This Code Do?

1. **Purpose:**  
   - It answers multiple range queries on an array in an efficient manner.
   - Each query asks for a property of the segment \([l, r)\) (for example, the sum or the number of distinct elements).
   - Only three functions are needed:
     - **add(i):** Incorporates the i-th element into the current segment.
     - **remove(i):** Removes the i-th element from the current segment.
     - **get():** Returns the answer based on the current segment.

2. **How It Works:**  
   - **Sorting Queries:**  
     The queries are sorted first by the block of the left endpoint (using block size \(B \approx \sqrt{Q}\)) and then by the right endpoint. This minimizes the cost of moving the segment boundaries.
   - **Processing Queries:**  
     The algorithm maintains a current segment \([l, r)\). For each sorted query, it adjusts \(l\) and \(r\) by calling `add` and `remove` functions so that the segment matches the query range, and then retrieves the answer via `get()`.
   - **Storing Answers:**  
     Each query’s result is stored in the answer list `ans` at the original query index.

3. **When to Use It:**  
   - Use this template when you have many queries that ask for an aggregate over a subarray (or segment) and you can efficiently update the answer by adding or removing a single element.
   - It works best when the cost of adding and removing an element (denoted as \(F\)) is low, yielding a total complexity of about \(O((N + Q) \cdot \sqrt{N} \cdot F)\).

4. **How to Use It (for Beginners):**  
   - **Define the Functions:**  
     Implement your own versions of `add(i)`, `remove(i)`, and `get()`, based on the particular problem you’re solving.
   - **Prepare Your Queries:**  
     Create a list of `Query` objects. Each `Query(l, r, idx)` represents a query over the segment \([l, r)\).  
   - **Call the `mo` Function:**  
     Prepare an answer list (which will be resized by `mo`) and pass it along with the queries and your functions.  
   - **Input/Output:**  
     In a contest (like CodeVita), you would read the input (number of queries, etc.), create the queries, process them using `mo`, and then output the results.

This Python version of Mo's algorithm provides a clean template for solving a wide range of segment query problems. Happy coding!
